"Need help: passport stuck due to mother‚Äôs surname mismatch Hey guys,

Need some advice. My passport application has been put on hold for the past 2 months after police verification. The issue is with my mother‚Äôs surname.

While applying, I accidentally entered her maiden surname (X). But in reality, after marriage she continued using X in most official documents since she‚Äôs a govt. employee (changing everywhere is a hassle). She only has one bank account in her married surname (Y).

Now, in my 10th marksheet her surname is Y, but in Aadhaar/PAN and most of her IDs it is still X. Passport office gave me an objection letter saying:

‚ÄúYour Mother name mentioned differs from the document furnished by you. Please give clarification for the name difference. Visit RPO, Bhopal with a prior enquiry appointment.‚Äù



I‚Äôve booked the rpo appointment next week. Question is ‚Äì what will require when I go there?

Should I just show my 10th marksheet and explain the mistake?

Will they definitely ask for my mother‚Äôs documents (Aadhaar/PAN)? If yes, those have X which won‚Äôt match the marksheet.

Or should I prepare an affidavit beforehand to explain the surname difference?



Anyone faced something similar? How strict are they about this?",Negative,2025-08-18 22:35:34,Conscious_Reason_353,Reddit,,2,2,Bhopal,2025,8,18,22

To start with, here is an overview of notable destinations in Madhya Pradesh, generated via perplexity, based on my history and places that are remaining...

  


[**MPT Sailani Island Resort**](https://mpstdc.com/accommodation/Sailani%20Island/MPT-Sailani-Island-Resort-SailaniIsland)

Guests enjoy the serene and tranquil setting surrounded by nature and water.Beautiful LocationThe resort is praised for its stunning views over the Narmada River and lush surroundings. Room MaintenanceSome guests mention the rooms could benefit from renovation and better upkeep.

MPT Sailani Island Resort is a unique resort located on Sailani Island near Omkareshwar, offering a scenic and tranquil getaway on the banks of the Narmada River. Noted for its panoramic water views, peace, and proximity to Sidhwarkut Jain Mandir, it is favored for both relaxation and aquatic activities.

**Tamia Hills (Satpura):**

* It is known for stunning **panoramic vistas**, dense forests, trekking opportunities, and proximity to the Patalkot Valley, which is celebrated for its biodiversity and tribal communities.
* Tamia's elevation is around 3,765 ft and the region is prized for birdwatching, photography, and serene viewpoints, including the Chhota Mahadev Cave, which features a perennial waterfall.

**Mandsore Mini Goa (Kanwala Village, Bhanpura):**

* Kanwala village in Bhanpura, Mandsaur district is called ""Mini Goa"" for its resemblance to Goa's beaches.
* It is situated on the banks of the wide Chambal River, where two large rocks in the water create an island-like effect.
* This location is popular during the monsoon (June-September) for its waves, sunsets, and natural beauty, but remains largely undeveloped, so visitors should bring their own food and supplies.

**Hanumantiya (near Khandwa):**

* Hanumantiya is another major water-based tourist destination in Madhya Pradesh, famous for activities around the Indira Sagar reservoir on the Narmada River (no direct search result above, but typically known for its water tourism, boat rides, and annual Jal Mahotsav festival).

**Madhai (Satpura):**

* Madhai is a unique entry zone to Satpura Tiger Reserve, requiring a short boat crossing of the Denwa River to access forest safaris.
* Known for pristine wildlife experiences, boat and jeep safaris, and diverse accommodation options, Madhai is both easily accessible and less crowded compared to other tiger reserves.
* Visitors can see tigers, leopards, sloth bears, and over 300 species of birds across varied terrain.

**Parsili:**

* Parsili is a small, eco-tourist village located on the banks of the Bansagar reservoir in Sidhi district (not covered directly in the above results, but widely recognized for its tranquility, riverside views, and eco-lodges).

**Dhubela:**

* Dhubela is best known for its historic fort and museums, especially the Maharaja Chhatrasal Museum, with significant Jain and Bundelkhand cultural sites (no direct search result above, but generally acknowledged as an archaeological and cultural destination near Chhatarpur).

These destinations collectively offer experiences ranging from hill shelter and tribal heritage (Tamia), beach vibes (Kanwala/Mini Goa), historic tourism (Dhubela), wildlife safaris (Madhai), unique island and water-based stays (Sailani Island Resort, Hanumantiya), and eco-leisure (Parsili).

For developed resorts or accommodation, Sailani Island Resort is notable for its quality and facilities. Madhai and Tamia also provide multiple stay options for varied budgets.",Negative,2025-08-12 13:02:17,shailendronCooparan,Reddit,,3,3,Bhopal,2025,8,12,13

To start with, here is an overview of notable destinations in Madhya Pradesh, generated via perplexity, based on my history and places that are remaining...

  


[**MPT Sailani Island Resort**](https://mpstdc.com/accommodation/Sailani%20Island/MPT-Sailani-Island-Resort-SailaniIsland)

Guests enjoy the serene and tranquil setting surrounded by nature and water.Beautiful LocationThe resort is praised for its stunning views over the Narmada River and lush surroundings. Room MaintenanceSome guests mention the rooms could benefit from renovation and better upkeep.

MPT Sailani Island Resort is a unique resort located on Sailani Island near Omkareshwar, offering a scenic and tranquil getaway on the banks of the Narmada River. Noted for its panoramic water views, peace, and proximity to Sidhwarkut Jain Mandir, it is favored for both relaxation and aquatic activities.

**Tamia Hills (Satpura):**

* Tamia is an offbeat hill station in the Chhindwara district, nestled in the Satpura Range.
* It is known for stunning **panoramic vistas**, dense forests, trekking opportunities, and proximity to the Patalkot Valley, which is celebrated for its biodiversity and tribal communities.
* Tamia's elevation is around 3,765 ft and the region is prized for birdwatching, photography, and serene viewpoints, including the Chhota Mahadev Cave, which features a perennial waterfall.

**Mandsore Mini Goa (Kanwala Village, Bhanpura):**

* Kanwala village in Bhanpura, Mandsaur district is called ""Mini Goa"" for its resemblance to Goa's beaches.
* It is situated on the banks of the wide Chambal River, where two large rocks in the water create an island-like effect.
* This location is popular during the monsoon (June-September) for its waves, sunsets, and natural beauty, but remains largely undeveloped, so visitors should bring their own food and supplies.

**Hanumantiya (near Khandwa):**

* Hanumantiya is another major water-based tourist destination in Madhya Pradesh, famous for activities around the Indira Sagar reservoir on the Narmada River (no direct search result above, but typically known for its water tourism, boat rides, and annual Jal Mahotsav festival).

**Madhai (Satpura):**

* Madhai is a unique entry zone to Satpura Tiger Reserve, requiring a short boat crossing of the Denwa River to access forest safaris.
* Known for pristine wildlife experiences, boat and jeep safaris, and diverse accommodation options, Madhai is both easily accessible and less crowded compared to other tiger reserves.
* Visitors can see tigers, leopards, sloth bears, and over 300 species of birds across varied terrain.

**Parsili:**

* Parsili is a small, eco-tourist village located on the banks of the Bansagar reservoir in Sidhi district (not covered directly in the above results, but widely recognized for its tranquility, riverside views, and eco-lodges).

**Dhubela:**

* Dhubela is best known for its historic fort and museums, especially the Maharaja Chhatrasal Museum, with significant Jain and Bundelkhand cultural sites (no direct search result above, but generally acknowledged as an archaeological and cultural destination near Chhatarpur).

These destinations collectively offer experiences ranging from hill shelter and tribal heritage (Tamia), beach vibes (Kanwala/Mini Goa), historic tourism (Dhubela), wildlife safaris (Madhai), unique island and water-based stays (Sailani Island Resort, Hanumantiya), and eco-leisure (Parsili).

"Want to Develop Rock Climbing And Adventure Tourism. Proposal: Developing Real Adventure Zones in Madhya Pradesh

Submitted by:
Harshit Bhawsar
Resident of Barwani District, Madhya Pradesh
Rock Climber & Outdoor Enthusiast

I am a passionate rock climber and adventurer from Barwani, MP. While our state promotes adventure tourism, most offerings are short-term paid activities focused on general tourists. What we truly lack is an ecosystem for serious outdoor adventurers and athletes.

Pachmarhi and Tamia are two locations with extraordinary potential for rock climbing, mountaineering, and Olympic-level adventure sports. These areas can be transformed into world-class adventure hubs, attracting professionals from across India and the globe to explore, train, and stay for extended periods‚Äînot just for quick, paid thrills.

My vision is to develop natural climbing zones, basecamps, and training areas in these regions, following sustainable and eco-friendly practices. I aim to create a space where real adventure thrives‚Äîled by community involvement, youth training, and international collaboration.

I seek the support and guidance of the Madhya Pradesh Government and MP Tourism to help with:
	‚Ä¢	Legal permissions and land access (especially forest areas)
	‚Ä¢	Departmental coordination (tourism, forest, and sports)
	‚Ä¢	Recognition and promotion as part of MP‚Äôs official adventure mission

Together, we can make MP a paradise for climbers and outdoor athletes while generating employment and boosting eco-tourism.

"Declared Dead, Born Alive: Two Shocking Cases of Medical Negligence **Case 1: Satna, Madhya Pradesh ‚Äì Durga Dwivedi**

* **Patient:** 24-year-old pregnant woman, high-risk case.
* **Hospital Chain:**

  * First admitted to *Amarpatan Civil Hospital*, then referred to *Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel District Hospital (Satna)*.
* **Timeline:**

  * 9 AM: Doctors conducted Doppler and sonography‚Äîno fetal heartbeat detected.
  * Doctors advised **abortion** based on this misdiagnosis.
* **Family Response:**

  * Refused abortion, sought second opinion.
  * At *Bharhutnagar Diagnostic Centre*, fresh scan showed **baby alive**.
* **Outcome:**

  * Rushed to a private nursing home.
  * **Healthy baby boy (3.5 kg)** delivered via C-section.
* **Fallout:**

  * Inquiry launched; **3 doctors under scrutiny**.
  * CMHO confirmed action pending based on negligence findings.

---

**Case 2: Vaishali, Bihar ‚Äì Kusum**

* **Patient:** Pregnant woman told her fetus had died at a local PHC.
* **Family:** Shocked, hired a private vehicle to go to another clinic.
* **Outcome:**

  * Gave **birth to a healthy baby girl en route** in the Bolero.
* **Impact:**

  * Family spent Rs. 4,000 on vehicle and cleaning‚Äîa big amount for agricultural workers.
  * Thankful the child survived despite false diagnosis.

---

**Key Takeaways**

* **Grave Medical Negligence:**
   Both cases expose **dangerously inaccurate fetal death diagnoses** in government hospitals‚Äîpotentially leading to wrongful abortions.

* **Trust in Public Healthcare Eroded:**
   Families had to **resort to private facilities** or even roadside births to ensure survival, highlighting a systemic trust deficit.

* **Need for Oversight & Equipment Checks:**
   These errors raise questions about **training, equipment quality**, and **accountability** in rural maternal care‚Äîprompting calls for reform.

"Unfair Behaviour by Landlord I want to share something that happened with someone I know recently (My friend's friend, Agarwal ji). I was their regular customer since 2019.

Back in 2013, he opened a shop in Govindpuri, gwalior ‚Äì actually two connected shops ‚Äì and was paying ‚Çπ40,000/month rent in total (landlord add 10% increment every year), just for the shop. Business was going well for years, it was the most famous and old shop in govindpuri area.

But a few months ago, bad time started. Business went down badly, he couldn‚Äôt manage rent, and finally had to close the shop and leave. He even tried to start again at a new location, but unfortunately, that also didn‚Äôt work out.

Now the landlord (Tripathi ji) gave one of the two shops to a paratha vendor (Sharma ji) for ‚Çπ10,000/month.

The other shop is still empty.

When Agarwal ji contacted Tripathi ji to request even one shop back, he refused completely, saying:

""Main apko nahi dunga, kisi aur ko de dunga chahe free me.""

And when Agarwal ji asked why the rent is ‚Çπ15,000 for him while Sharma ji got it for ‚Çπ10,000, Tripathi ji replied very rudely:

""use toh me 500 me de du, aapko usse kya?""

After that, Agarwal ji didn‚Äôt contact him again. He just lost hope.

This doesn‚Äôt feel right. After so many years of loyalty and rent payments, is this how shopkeepers are treated? Is this how someone should treat someone in his time bad instead of helping him out?",Negative,2025-07-15 12:08:24,Either-Screen-5524,Reddit,,3,5,Gwalior,2025,7,15,12

"MP shocker: 'Jealous' over her friend's progress, woman throws acid on her; Arrested. In a deeply disturbing case from Jabalpur, MP, a 21 yr old BBA student named Shraddha Das suffered severe acid burns allegedly at the hands of her childhood friend and college mate, Ishita Sahu (22). The incident took place on the night of Sunday, June 29, 2025, under the Gwarighat police station jurisdiction.

Preliminary investigations point to jealousy over Shraddha‚Äôs academic and professional progress as the motive. The accused had not been on speaking terms with the victim for months. On the pretext of giving her a ""surprise,"" Ishita called Shraddha outside her house and threw acid on her after a brief conversation. Shraddha sustained 50% burns on her face, hands & legs, but is reported to be in stable condition.

---

**Key Details**

* **Victim**: Shraddha Das (21 or 23 as per varying reports), a BBA student.
* **Accused**: Ishita Sahu (22), also a BBA student and childhood friend of Shraddha.
* **Incident Time & Place**: Sunday night, June 29, around 10:30 PM, at Awadhpuri Colony, Jabalpur.
* **Injuries**: Shraddha sustained 50% burns; admitted to a private hospital, condition stable.
* **Attack Method**: Ishita lured Shraddha outside claiming she had a **surprise**. After a short chat, she threw acid from a jar and fled.
* **Witnesses & Response**:

  * Shraddha‚Äôs mother heard her screams, found her injured & rushed her to hospital after trying to mitigate the burns.
* **Background**:

  * Once close friends, the two had a falling out months ago. Shraddha had blocked Ishita‚Äôs number.
  * Shraddha's mother claimed Ishita was jealous of Shraddha‚Äôs multiple jobs and stable life, while Ishita was unemployed.
  * Police believe jealousy either personal, academic or economic was a likely motive.
* **Involvement of Others**:

  * Ishita reportedly procured the acid from a shop by falsely claiming it was for college use, accompanied by a man she introduced as a teacher.
  * Shraddha‚Äôs family alleges Ishita‚Äôs mother may have been involved. Her parents are reportedly absconding.
* **Legal Action**:

  * Ishita has been arrested.
  * She has been booked under **BNS Section 124(2)** (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by acid).

---

* **Jealousy & emotional instability among youth**, especially rooted in academic, professional or personal comparisons can escalate into dangerous territory.
* **Premeditation & misuse of institutional cover** - the acid was allegedly procured by pretending it was for college use, **raising questions about acid sale regulation**.
* **Family dynamics and possible complicity** - the victim‚Äôs family suspects the accused‚Äôs mother was involved & the absconding parents add another layer to the investigation.

"UP Woman lures MP man online, marries him in fake wedding, then kills for property. A heartbreaking case of emotional exploitation and premeditated murder has emerged from UP, where a **45 yr old man from MP** was lured because of his own viral video, into a fake marriage plot, only to be killed for his property. The woman behind the plot, posing with a false identity, allegedly planned to claim his land by pretending to be his widow.

---

**Key Details**

* **Victim**: Indra Kumar Tiwari (45), a schoolteacher and farmer from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh. Recently lost both parents, had no siblings, and was searching for a life partner.

* **Trigger**: In a viral video clip, Indra was seen asking spiritual influencer Aniruddhacharya why he was still unmarried despite having land and a job. The video gained traction online.

* **The Trap**: Sahiba Bano (accused), upon watching the video, hatched a plan to exploit Indra. She assumed a fake identity as ‚ÄúKhushi Tiwari‚Äù using forged documents and contacted him via social media.

* **Fake Marriage**: Indra was invited to Kushinagar, UP, for a wedding. He mortgaged land, carried ‚Çπ1.5 lakh in cash, and bought jewelry for his ‚Äúbride‚Äù.

* **Murder**: On May 30, shortly after a staged wedding with help from two accomplices, Indra was stabbed and his body was dumped in a drain in the Hata area.

* **Discovery**: His phone was switched off from June 5. Friends and relatives filed a missing person report on June 8. His body remained unidentified until June 27, when it was matched with Jabalpur police records.

* **Aftermath**: The accused planned to use the wedding photos to claim his **18 bighas of land as his widow**. One accomplice, Kushal Gaud, who had also been deceived in a similar way earlier, was arrested. Sahiba Bano was also arrested later.

---

**Key Takeaways**

* **Emotional Exploitation via Social Media**: A viral video expressing personal vulnerability was weaponized for financial gain.

* **Premeditated & Gendered Crime**: This was a calculated trap involving false identity, fake documents and manipulation.

* **Fake Marriages as a New Front for Property Crimes**: Highlights a disturbing trend where marriage is used as a legal and emotional smokescreen for property acquisition through murder.

* **Isolation Made Him a Target**: Indra‚Äôs lack of close family made him an ideal victim for such a scam.

* **Police Effort**: While initial identification took nearly three weeks, coordinated efforts between Jabalpur and Kushinagar police led to breakthroughs and arrests.

**Update: Bail After 100 Days in Jail & Trial Ordered**

* **Alka Jain released** on **bail** after **100 days** in jail (granted by Gwalior High Court on June 16, 2025).
* **Court rejected SIT‚Äôs closure report** (submitted May 5) and ordered a full **trial** under charges of **murder and evidence tampering**.
* The **SIT**, after consulting medical experts, concluded **death was by partial hanging**, not strangulation‚Äîthus clearing Alka.
* **CJM Madhulika Mule** refused the closure report on **May 9**, citing **13 critical questions** about the investigation.
* Bail plea was filed by the family on **May 14**; delays followed until approval on **June 16**.
* **Alka‚Äôs family**, including in-laws and siblings, received her emotionally outside the jail.
* Despite the SIT clean chit, the **court found sufficient grounds** to continue with trial proceedings.
* The case has seen **three narrative shifts**:

  1. Police accused the mother
  2. SIT declared her innocent
  3. Court rejected the closure and revived full trial
* The tragedy has left the **family deeply fractured**, with Abhyudaya remembered as a boy who made reels with his mother and was active on social media.

"Can an Indian in Madhya Pradesh help me locate my family's 'bahi' genealogical record at Ujjain and other places of religious pilgrimage? Hello all, I am a young, amateur genealogist from Canada with a passion for the hobby and history. My father is ethnically a Punjabi Jatt Sikh (my mother is of European-origin), born in the United Kingdom. My paternal grandmother was born in undivided India in the Moga district of Punjab whilst my paternal grandfather was born in the British colony of Malaya (though he was ethnically Punjabi Jatt Sikh with family origins from the Moga and Ludhiana districts).

I have been researching my family's genealogy for some time now, whilst researching the European-side has been relatively smooth due to an abundance of records, the Indian side of my family has always been more difficult due to a lack of records. This is due to India not maintaining as many records on its population when compared to other countries, especially during the colonial and pre-colonial periods. I have only been able to locate land-records from some lineages of my Indian family but these are less-than-ideal for a variety of reasons, also I have to use whatever documents still in my family's possession (such as old passports) and my still-living grandmother's memory to piece together the rest... I am yearning and eager for more data to build-up my Indian family-tree, which leads me to the Hindu genealogy registers...

I have been researching the Hindu genealogical records (known as *bahi/vahi*, also known as *pothi*, another term is *bahi-khata*) maintained by a class of Hindu priests (I also updated/created Wikipedia articles on them to help others) known as *tirth purohits*, informally known as *pandas*. These genealogical records are kept at around 25 sites of Hindu pilgrimage around India, mostly in the Gangetic plains region. These sites were visited by pilgrims from all-over India, so there is a chance my Punjabi ancestors may have paid a visit to them as well. I would love to be able to consult the records but I have an issue: I am located in Canada and have no means of visiting India anytime soon and I lack any conversational ability in any Indian-language (aside from my baby-level Punjabi). Thus, me visiting these places and trying to find my family's *panda* seems hopeless unless a native Indian can help me. I do know my family's ancestral villages for the most-part, I know our *jƒÅti* and our *gotra*, I also know most of the names of my ancestors, so I should be able to locate the correct *panda* and *bahi* genealogical register of my relevant ancestors. Many Sikh families used to also take their ashes to these Hindu sites to disperse them until taking them to Kiratpur became more popularized with Sikhs in the 19th-20th century, thus I should be able to find some records of my family at these Hindu sites, even though we are Sikhs, but it has probably been a while since a member of my family last visited and updated the genealogical registers there. Perhaps my Hindu ancestors before my family converted to Sikhism centuries back could be found there, I am not sure.

The beauty of the Internet is I can elicit the help of others who are located halfway around the world. Would any Indians in Madhya Pradesh living in or near these popular places of Hindu pilgrimage where these records are kept be willing to assist a foreigner with this task? I can provide you my family details and if you could find and ask the relevant *panda* for my family's genealogical details, I would be eternally grateful. My Indian family are Punjabi Jatt Sikhs of the Gill, Sandhu, Toor, and possibly Khaira clans.

The relevant records in Madhya Pradesh should be found at the following place(s) of Hindu pilgrimage, where genealogical bahi records are kept by pandas for pilgrims:

"Meet the New Baba in Town ‚Äì Brewing Tea, Boiling Over 498A Injustice Meet **Krishna Kumar Dhakad**, also known as **498 wale baba**, operating a tea stall in Neemuch, Madhya Pradesh. But, what looks like a simple tea stand is actually a boiling protest. 

**Personal Backstory**

* **Allegations Filed**: Dhakad claims his wife lodged a false dowry case against him under Sec.‚ÄØ498A (IPC).  
* **The Protest Booth**: To voice his dissent against this alleged misuse, he opened the **498A Tea Cafe** in her own village - serving chai as a symbolic act against wrongful arrests.  
* **Symbolic Handcuffs**: He sometimes serves tea while wearing handcuffs to represent both the literal and metaphorical constraints he feels from unjust legal action.  
* **Boiling Until Justice**: His catchphrase - *‚ÄúJab tak nahi milta nyaay, tab tak ubalti rahegi chai‚Äù* underscores his vow: the kettle (and the protest) will continue until he gets what he regards as fair treatment.
* **Public & Emotional Toll**: He reports experiencing significant mental and social strain due to the accusations and seeks to help other men who may be suffering under legal misuse.  
* **Local Sympathy**: His tea stall **has become a center of public conversation in Baran,** with *many locals supporting his stance*.
---

**Legal & Societal Context**

* **Judicial Concern**: The SC has acknowledged that Section‚ÄØ498A has sometimes been used as a tool for *legal terrorism* or personal vendetta - calling it a misuse of criminal law.  

* **Legal Safeguards**: The SC also recently quashed numerous false 498A FIRs, reaffirming that prosecution must be based on specific, prima facie evidence - not blanket accusations.  

* **Ongoing Reform Talks**: In 2024, India‚Äôs Law Ministry, acknowledging Supreme Court warnings, began discussions to review and refine how the law addresses and punishes false complaints.  

* **Policy Demands**: Advocates are calling for stronger verification before arrests, better legal protections for the accused, and broader gender-neutral reform in matrimonial law.

**Why This Story Matters**

Dhakad‚Äôs story goes beyond a personal protest - it taps into a larger national concern over **potential abuse of protective laws**, **judicial safeguards for false allegations**, and **the emotional toll on wrongly accused men and their families**. His **498A Tea Cafe** stands as both a local landmark and a public statement within this ongoing conversation.

"300th Jayanti of Rani Ahilyabai Holkar, truly one of the greatest queens of history. Widowed young, took over the kingdom, ruled with distinction. 
Ahilyabai Holkar, the daughter in law of Malhar Rao Holkar, founder of the Holkar dynasty  of Indore.

Rebulilt many Hindu temples, offered facilities for pilgrims, built a new capital at Maheswar on the banks of the Narmada, known for her administrative ability and wisdom.

She never observed purdah, held daily durbars and was always accessible to the public.  Her first principle of government appears to have been moderate assessment, and respect for the native rights of village officers and proprietors of land.

She heard every complaint in person; and although she continually referred cases to courts of equity and arbitration, and to her ministers for settlement, she was always accessible.

While Indore developed under Ahilyabhai‚Äôs reign, into a prosperous trading town,  she also developed her own capital at Maheswar on the banks of the Narmada. She built many temples there, a fort, a palace, repaired many ghats. 

Maheswar during her time, turned out to be a center for literature and arts.  The famous Marathi poet Moropant, the shahir Anatapandhi was patronized by her as well as the Sanskrit scholar Khushali Ram.

The textile industry flourished in Maheshwar during her reign, and the city is home to the famous Maheswari sari.  She also patronized many craftsmen, sculptors, artistes who made the city their home. 

Trees were planted along roads, wells were dug and rest houses set up for travelers. She reached out to the poor and homeless, gave them shelter and dignity. 

When the Bhils were harassing the caravans she talked out with them, persuaded them to give up their nomadic lifestyle granted them land for cultivation.

Her daily routine was quite simple, rose an hour before daybreak to say her prayers, read the scriptures, and distributed alms. After breakfast, she took a short break, and then attended durbar listening to people, settling disputes, taking decisions on administrative matters. 

A devout Shaivaite, she would mark Shri Shankara on all royal proclamations along with her signature. 

Ahilyabai built and also repaired many temples all over India, some of her more famous works are rebuilding the Kashi Viswanath temple after it was destroyed by Aurangzeb, there is also an Ahilya Ghat at Varanasi as well as the Ahilya Dwarkeswar temple.

The Chatri of her father in law Malhar Rao Holkar was built at Alampur in MP as well as many temples here.  Also built the Treta Ram temple in Ayodhya.   Apart from that she also repaired the Manikarnika, Dasasvamedh Ghats, built Dharamshalas at Varanasi.

From Badrinath to Dwarka, from Omkareswar to Puri, from Gaya to Rameswaram, every holy pilgrimage site in India, had a contribution in one way or other from Ahilyabhai Holkar be it temples, dharmashalas, bathing ghats. Naman.

"Seeking Insights on MP PNST Exam for BSc Nursing in Government Colleges 

Recently, I‚Äôve been exploring career options for my younger sister and came across the MP PNST exam for BSc Nursing in government colleges in Madhya Pradesh. I found some information, including:

1. There are approximately 1,800 seats available across Madhya Pradesh.
2. The cutoff for general category candidates last year was around 50 marks.
3. Clearing the PNST exam reportedly allows candidates to pursue BSc Nursing at no cost and may lead to government job opportunities.

I‚Äôd like to hear from candidates who have taken this exam or are currently enrolled in the course. I understand competition exists everywhere, but is the MP PNST exam highly competitive? If any aspirants or students can share their experiences, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it.

"Seeking urgent advice: Repeated incidents of indecent exposure near our apartment building (Bhopal) 
Hi everyone, I‚Äôm posting here because I‚Äôm extremely concerned and unsure what steps to take next. I live in Green Bay Apartments near Shanti Nagar Bypass, Bhopal. For the past few days, we‚Äôve been facing a deeply disturbing issue.

At night, usually between 2 AM and 4 AM, strange men have been loitering behind our building boundaries and masturbating in full view of our apartments. Sometimes they even flash laser lights at our balconies and windows to catch our attention. Initially, we thought it was just one person, but over time, we‚Äôve noticed changes in body shape and behavior, which makes us believe there are multiple people involved.

It‚Äôs not just limited to our building‚Äîneighbors in the nearby buildings have reported similar incidents.

The most troubling part: when we once tried to scare him away using our phone‚Äôs flashlight (to make it seem like we were recording), instead of running away, he stepped closer to the boundary and exposed himself even more blatantly, using his own mobile flash to highlight his actions. This shows that his mindset is extremely disturbing and likely to worsen.

We‚Äôve never seen their faces, which makes it scarier because they could potentially enter our society during the day and we wouldn‚Äôt recognize them.

Some of our friends who live in the same building (and have been facing the same issue) contacted the police. The police came, but unfortunately, they appeared drunk and dismissed it, acting like it wasn‚Äôt serious.

We haven‚Äôt directly taken any action ourselves yet because we are worried about our safety. We have no idea how many people are actually involved, and we fear that if they realize we are taking action, they might retaliate or harm us in some way.

We‚Äôre feeling helpless and anxious about how far this could escalate. Does anyone have practical advice on:
	‚Ä¢	How to escalate this effectively, especially when the local police response has been poor?
	‚Ä¢	Ways to stay safe and protect ourselves in the meantime?
	‚Ä¢	Any surveillance or deterrents that are discreet but effective?

Any advice, resources, or shared experiences would be really appreciated. Thank you in advance.",Negative,2025-05-03 03:35:09,Parking-Warthog-1179,Reddit,,3,17,Bhopal,2025,5,3,3

What‚Äôs more surprising is that this isn‚Äôt a new thing‚Äîit‚Äôs been happening for a couple of years now, not just in Chhatarpur but in many other small districts as well. But still, it raises a bigger question‚Äîwhat do people actually think about this? Is it just a local adjustment to practical problems, or are we slowly ignoring the value of small change altogether?",Negative,2025-05-03 00:34:12,ZealousidealSign4600,Reddit,,4,2,Chhatarpur,2025,5,3,0

"In MP's Indore, a doctor refused to treat a Muslim patient in response to the PahalgamTerrorAttack.

She Later Deleted The Post. In a now-deleted Facebook post, a doctor from Madhya Pradesh Indore city shared her conversation with a Muslim patient from Maharashtra refusing treatment, solely on the basis of her religious identity.

Dr Neha Arora Verma, whose Instagram profile is described as ""Spine Specialist, UK, PCOD Reversal Expert, Intimate Women Health Specialist, Cosmetic Acupuncturist"", shared a screenshot of the conversation where the patient complained about her knee pain. Verma asks the patient's name, to which the latter replies, 'Mrs Farah Hussain.'

The doctor replies, ""Am sorry, we are no longer taking any Muslim patients in our center. Hope you find someone better in your area.""

Her Facebook status read: We have started this Change. When they can kill our people according to our caste, we are now denying treatment as per caste.

I‚Äôm feeling sad for Husband here, if anyone need TLDR

A 27-year-old married woman in Bhopal was allegedly raped by Rajat Paithari, whom she met on Instagram in December 2022. Paithari lured her to his rented home in Piplani under the pretext of marriage, despite knowing she was married with a toddler. He raped her multiple times, promising to marry her and care for her son, and threatened to defame her with photos and videos if she refused. He also physically assaulted her and threatened her family. After Paithari sent a photo to her husband, the woman reported the ordeal to Piplani police, who registered a rape case and began investigations.",Negative,2025-04-27 07:30:27,Area51Eskapee,Reddit,,16,20,Bhopal,2025,4,27,7

"Jabalpur (MP): Woman and Lover Arrested for ‚Çπ38 Lakh Fraud, Duped Husband and In Laws with Fake Govt. Job Promises and Fake Gold 
In a shocking case from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, a woman named Pooja Dubey and her lover Akash Nema were arrested for defrauding her husband and in-laws of Rs 38 lakh under the false pretext of securing government jobs. 

The duo also orchestrated a sophisticated scam involving the replacement of ancestral and wedding jewellery with fake ornaments. The fraud, which unfolded over nearly two years post-marriage, came to light only after the victim's father tried to obtain a gold loan and discovered the swap.

---

**Key Details**  
- **Victims**: Aditya Mishra (husband), Rudra Pratap Mishra (father-in-law)  
- **Accused**: Pooja Dubey (wife), Akash Nema (lover; falsely introduced as 'adopted brother')  
- **Amount Defrauded**: ‚Çπ38 lakh between Aug 2022 and July 2024  
- **Modus Operandi**:  
   - Promised government jobs for Aditya and Pooja  
   - Collected money in multiple installments  
   - Replaced ~460 grams of real gold with fake ornaments  

---

**Breakdown of Events**  

**1. The Plot**  
- In 2021, Aditya Mishra married Pooja Dubey from Narsinghpur.  
- Soon after, Pooja introduced Akash Nema as her 'adopted brother' with political connections who could help them get government jobs.  
- Despite Rudra Pratap's (father-in-law) refusal to fund the scheme, Pooja convinced Aditya to transfer money secretly.

**2. The Deed**  
- Between Aug 2022 and July 2024, Aditya transferred Rs 38 lakh to Akash‚Äôs account through multiple transactions.  
- Akash frequently visited the family, showed photos of supposed job placements, and maintained the illusion.  

**3. The Gold Swap**  
- In parallel, Pooja and Akash planned a gold replacement scheme.  
- Pooja secretly took photos of the family‚Äôs gold ornaments.  
- Fake replicas were made in Indore and Mumbai for around ‚Çπ10,000.  
- The swap was executed when the family was away.

**4. Discovery**  
- In Nov 2024, Rudra Pratap took gold for a loan but was told it was fake.  
- Upon confronting Pooja, she gave evasive answers and soon left for Narsinghpur.  
- Aditya later admitted to giving her Rs 38 lakh for job promises.  
- A formal complaint was lodged in February 2025.

**5. Investigation & Arrest**  
- Akash initially escaped from a hospital where he was admitted after being caught.  
- Eventually, both were arrested from Narsinghpur in March 2025.  
- During interrogation, they revealed the location of the hidden jewellery.  
- Police recovered:  
   - 60g from their home  
   - 290g from Bajaj Finance (pawned)  
   - 110g from Goyal Jewellers  

**6. Counter-Allegation & Remand**  
- Pooja tried to deflect charges by alleging dowry harassment.  
- The court remanded both accused to judicial custody.  
- The police are still investigating the role of Pooja‚Äôs family and attempting to trace the remaining money.

---

**Police Action/Inaction & Current Investigation Status**  

- **Feb 2025**: Complaint filed at Madan Mahal police station  
- **Early Mar 2025**: Akash arrested, then escapes from hospital  
- **5 Mar 2025**: Both Pooja and Akash taken into custody  
- **Post-Arrest Recovery**:  
   - 460g gold recovered from three locations  
   - ‚Çπ1 lakh in cash  
   - A luxury car worth ‚Çπ17 lakh bought with the swindled money  
   - **Ongoing**: Search for remaining money; inquiry into role of Pooja‚Äôs family

---

**Key Takeaways**  

- Long-term frauds can be orchestrated within families using emotional manipulation. Pooja misused trust as a wife and daughter-in-law to execute a long term con.
- Gender-neutral investigation is critical in fraud and financial exploitation cases.  
- Fake job promise scams need stronger public awareness and legal deterrents.  
- Replacing family jewellery with fake ornaments is an emerging criminal trend.  
- Attempt to counter-accuse with dowry harassment reflects a possible defensive misuse of gendered laws.

"Online Community formation to drive a change Hello everyone. I am a citizen residing in Ujjain city. I have an initiative in my mind of starting an online community that forms small independent communities across the state of Madhya Pradesh ( Spreading across the whole of India ) for spreading information about cleanliness, better education, sectors that need a growth for the advancement of the State, better opportunities for people in the State and many more. I want to begin this journey by organizing a cleaning drive with at least 40 people (mainly youngsters aged b/w 10 and 25, elders are also appreciated) in any park or a famous place in the city that can be cleaned within an hour. We will then brief on our idea of what we will be doing alongside cleaning. We will take different examples, such as ""Indore"" for the cleaning sector, and then talk about places and sectors that are revolutionizing India, how education about technology can help learners enhance their productivity, and why and how communities are necessary for everyone to help each other, etc.

We need to form communities like this in different States and cities that will work together to create a small change and then scale it online so that everyone can benefit from it and can start forming communities like this in their locality. We plan to do this on any given data that can be mutually decided by the members of the participants who wish to make a better future for themselves and the upcoming generations. I know it might not sound possible, but we have Internet and we can drive a change if we want to. We need young people, so please spread this message as much as you can on other social media platforms too, and if you are not from Ujjain, you can implement this at your place too.

We will discuss all aspects of this plan and how to seek support from official bodies, if we can, and scale it as much as possible. You can also connect with communities that you already know of if you don't want to form your own.",Positive,2025-04-19 18:39:00,Unknown,Reddit,,3,4,Indore,2025,4,19,18

However, I remembered, I wish to see the marble cliffs of Jabalpur. I wish to see Narmada badly. Find it exotic (fellow Rajasthani here - water is attractive). 

It will be helpful, if someone could guide me on what places should I visit or I can cover, I am open to natural/cultural/historical - all sorts of tourism.

I am a solo woman traveller, so also wanted to know if it is safe to travel to certain locations like Sanchi in MP. 
I will be traveling via public transport trains and may be cabs wherever required.

Hope to receive insightful suggestions.

"Urgent help (GWALIOR) There's a little girl in urgent need of support. She has suffered severe blood loss, and while her medical treatment has started, her recovery now depends on basic care and comfort. I know ham log roz thoda bohot kharcha kar dete hai, paise nahi dena chahte to atleast fal juice ya kuch kapde de aao.

Her family is unable to afford proper shelter, nutrition, and hygiene essentials. What she needs now includes:

*A tripal (plastic sheet or cover) to protect her from direct sunlight

*Some fresh fruits for strength

*Basic female hygiene products to help prevent any infections

*Clean clothes and care

This is a high priority situation. Any small contribution can truly make a difference for her recovery.

"Soon, people will start migrating to other places due to extreme heat and other environmental problems, because our leadership doesn't care Deforestation is increasing every year, but no one seems to worry about it because it doesn't create a sense of emergency for anyone. Neither do the people care, nor does the government.

This article is about deforestation in Rajgarh District, which accounts for 5% of forest land out of the total land area. There's no monitoring of tree cutting and no enforcement of reforestation for the trees being cut. We are not ready for what's coming next... extreme heat... water scarcity...

A different source - I think FPI - blamed the victims of dog attacks for what the dog & dog owners do to us every day, by stating that we must not ""provoke"" the dogs. Dog owners and dogs have destroyed nearly every freedom I had. Also, yet again, the dog and all those who support dogs get to leave without any consequences for its actions.

I've just witnessed the recent post from this sub about the police is accused of colluding with rapists that went to their victim's house, beat up their family, and then burned their house for complaining about the rape and not submitting to the rapists. Their conduct is no different than dog owners who use violence, either themselves or by proxy with their dog as their weapon and molestation machine, in order to further ""punish"" their victim or get perverted joy from molesting them.

"Elderly Woman and Her Son Brutally Assaulted by Daughter-in-Law and Her Family in Gwalior, MP (Caught on CCTV) In a disturbing case from Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, a 70-year-old woman named **Sarla Batra** and her son **Vishal Batra** were brutally assaulted inside their home by Vishal‚Äôs wife **Neelika** and her family members. The attack, which was caught on CCTV, took place in the **Shinde Ki Chhawani** area and was reportedly triggered by a dispute over the elderly woman‚Äôs refusal to go to an old age home - allegedly part of a plan by Neelika to gain control over the family property.

Despite clear CCTV evidence, the police initially refused to file a case, allegedly due to the influence of the accused. An FIR was finally registered **four days later** after the victims approached senior officers.

---

**Key Details**  
- **Victims**: Sarla Batra (70), her son Vishal Batra  
- **Accused**: Neelika (daughter-in-law), her father **Surendra Kohli**, brother **Nanak Kohli**, and four unidentified accomplices  
- **Date of Incident**: April 1, 2025, 2 PM
- **Location**: Shinde Ki Chhawani, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh      
- **Police Station**: Inderganj Police Station  

---

**Breakdown of Events**  
- Sarla Batra lived with her son Vishal, his wife Neelika, and their children. Her husband had passed away four years ago.
- According to Sarla, Neelika frequently quarreled with her and had tried to send her to an old age home to take control of the house.
- On the day of the incident, a minor household argument escalated when Neelika began verbally abusing Sarla.
- Vishal intervened, after which Neelika called her father **Surendra** and brother **Nanak**, who barged into the house with four other men.
- The group **verbally abused Sarla and Vishal**, then **physically assaulted Vishal**.
- When Sarla tried to shield her son, Neelika **pushed her to the ground, kicked her, dragged her by the hair**, and **slammed her head against a wall**.
- The violence continued outside the house, and the accused **allegedly issued death threats** if the victims reported the incident.
- **Sarla and Vishal went to the police station, but the accused were already present. Despite showing CCTV footage, the police refused to register a complaint**.
- **Only after approaching senior officers four days later was an FIR filed, and DSP Robin Jain confirmed the case was under investigation**.

---

**Police Action/Inaction & Current Investigation Status**  
  
- **Day 0 (April 1, 2025 approx.)**: Incident occurs; victims attempt to file complaint but police allegedly refuse despite CCTV evidence.  
- **Day 4 (April 4, 2025)**: Victims approach senior officers; FIR is finally filed.  
- **Current Status**: DSP Robin Jain confirmed registration of the case; police are examining CCTV footage. No confirmation yet on arrests or charges.

---

## **Key Takeaways**  
- The case underscores the **plight of elderly individuals in domestic settings**, especially in disputes involving property.  
- Raises questions about **police apathy and possible influence**, especially in cases involving intra family violence.  
- CCTV footage played a crucial role in bringing the matter to light and countering initial inaction.

"The Unfair Fallout of Nalin Yadav ‚Äì A Comedian From Indore Silenced Without a Word Many of us have heard about Munawar Faruqui‚Äôs arrest in Indore back in 2021, but how many know about Nalin Yadav, the comedian whose career was destroyed even though he didn‚Äôt say a single controversial word?

Nalin, a young stand-up comedian from Indore, was arrested alongside Munawar simply because he was part of the event. Unlike Munawar, Nalin didn't even get a chance to perform, yet he spent weeks in jail. His only ""crime"" was sharing the stage.

After his release, Nalin faced immense difficulties. He struggled to find gigs, as venues feared backlash. His social media presence was wiped out. While Munawar eventually rebuilt his career, Nalin remained largely forgotten‚Äîanother casualty of intolerance, despite having done nothing wrong.

Is this the fate of artists in Madhya Pradesh and India as whole? A young comedian's dreams shattered just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time? If a person can be punished for something they didn‚Äôt even say, what does that mean for freedom of expression in our state?

I get to know about this case by Shashi Tharoor's X post where he requested authorities in MP to please leave Nalin Yadav from unwanted things he isn't even responsible for. 

After his comedy career shattered he tried to join a marketing company, but the moment company get to know about his case, he was fired. 

Now he is working in a real estate company with struggling income.

Not just Nalin but there are a lot of people with same or different profession getting affected by this unfair judicial and political dynamics in the country. 

I felt it's important to mention here.

This morning around 4:30 near jabalpur , their bus got into an accident resulting in death of some passenger and many more are injured . It was so tragic people lost arms or legs . Thankfully my mom and dad are rescued and also injured . The bus was rash driving and slipped due to driver dozing off ,ended up losing the balance of bus and turning upside down. I am so panicked rn and can't understand what to do. My mom lost her phone and it's been stolen I asked them to register a complaint for phone. What else can we do? Where can we file a complaint against bus services, is there any govt official website for that?

The bus service was prassana purple ram rath which had good rating as well.There is no response from red bus yet.The driver fled from the scene and didnt take any accountibility to make people reach homes. Around 15 passengers are severly injured, out of all of 36 people only my dad was able to get out and stand on his legs . He rescued my mom by breaking the glass and also helped to get other people out till the ambulance arrived. He also helped to rescue many people who were stuck.

 If the bus was turned on the right side there was no way they would have been saved cause people literally got crushed. I am just so still shocked knowing the fact that I would have become a orphan in seconds.

"Girl Suicide case in Bhopal 
After I played Holi, when I got home, my friend called me and said that a girl in his society had done suicide. I was shocked to hear that the reason for suicide hadn't been clear by the parents, but from what I had heard, the girl's friends were rushing to stop her. They say they knew she would do that the girl sent a video to her friends before the suicide and her friends showed the video to her parents but they refuse to take action they say nothing can be done also from what I have heard she came in a black car and there were four boys arguing with her shouting and scramming. They were not from the colony. My friend told me that her boyfriend recorded some nude videos of her and blackmailed her but he said that was sorted out some say that the boys drug her and raped her and recorded a video of her or something and the boys family are powerful so her parents can't do anything they also have a son who is 4 or r years old so they are scared to take action 

The girl's name is Anjali 


TL;DR:** After Holi, I learned about a girl who took her own life after allegedly being blackmailed, drugged, and raped by powerful individuals. Her parents are too scared to take action, and the system seems rigged against them. This needs to stop. We need justice.

"Low Budget Trip to Ujjain ‚Äì Should I Book a Package or Plan Myself? Hey everyone, I‚Äôm planning a budget trip to Ujjain, MP, and I‚Äôm trying to figure out the best way to save money. I checked some packages on MakeMyTrip and other platforms, but they seem expensive. So, I‚Äôm wondering:

1. If I book a hotel online by myself and then hire a cab locally, would it be cheaper?

2. What are the approximate charges for cabs in Ujjain to visit Omkareshwar?

3. Has anyone done a trip like this and found that booking everything separately (hotel + cab) was actually cheaper than a package deal?

I checked hotel rates and cab fares, and it looks like doing it myself would cost less than the packages. But I want to hear from others who have been there. Any tips?",Negative,2025-03-19 13:23:48,iamsurti,Reddit,,1,1,Ujjain,2025,3,19,13

"What is happening in this country Yesterday, I was playing Holi with some of my friends in our society. We are a small group of school friends, all working jobs, and we reunite during Holi and Diwali when everyone returns home for the occasion.

While we were celebrating, some random guys came and started applying color to our female friend without her consent. We saw this and confronted them, leading to an argument. After the argument, they left. However, in the evening, they returned and started shouting in the society compound. Some of them even made vulgar comments. Among them were a few yuva netas (young political leaders) from the ruling party.

When we went down to confront them again, they took out lathis and rods from their car, attempting to attack us. We ran towards our house and called for help. Soon, several people and society members gathered in the compound, which scared them. They then started justifying themselves by saying they belonged to a certain political party and accused us of ""destroying Hindu culture."" They even questioned why a Muslim friend of ours was playing Holi with us.

Our Muslim friend not only celebrates with us but also visits temples and is a vegetarian‚Äînot for religious reasons but because he cannot digest meat. His family never objects to his choices. If he is playing Holi with us, why should anyone else care? These brain-dead people think they are ""saving"" a religion that has survived a thousand years of invasions.

When they continued their harassment, we called the police. The officers took them away, but we know they‚Äôll likely be released within a couple of hours. It makes me wonder‚Äîwhere do these guys get so much confidence to act like this?

I also saw news from Ujjain that someone was stabbed to death over an argument during Holi celebrations. It's disturbing how such violence is becoming common.

"Is MP Just a ‚ÄòCheap Bihar‚Äô for Bollywood? This might trigger some people, but as a Bhopali, I have to say it‚Äîwhy does Bollywood treat Madhya Pradesh like a discount version of Bihar?

Every time a movie is shot in Bhopal or anywhere in MP, they never actually show MP‚Äôs culture or stories. Instead, they portray it as Bihar or UP. Why? Because our infrastructure is so outdated and rundown that it fits the stereotype they want to show for those states? Or is MP just too cheap and convenient for filmmakers to bother shooting in the real locations?

If Bihar is as bad as they love to show, why not shoot there directly? Why use MP as a stand-in? The fact that filmmakers find MP cheaper than Bihar should tell us something.

And before anyone jumps in with Panchayat or Stree as counterexamples, take a moment to actually think about the trend I‚Äôm pointing out.

On February 24, the girl who left for school suddenly disappeared, after which her family made a ruckus. During the investigation, the police found that the student had befriended the young man from Mathura on Instagram. When the student could not contact her family in Mathura, she called her status from the auto driver's mobile and told her situation. The minor told that she had left the house with 11 thousand rupees. The police, while taking action promptly, recovered the student from Mathura.

"Should Madhya Pradesh be divided for better development? MP is huge, but is it really working as one state? Most of the focus always goes to Bhopal, Indore, and a few other cities, while regions like Bundelkhand, Baghelkhand, and Mahakaushal keep getting ignored. These places have their own identity, culture, and issues, but they barely get any proper attention.

We‚Äôve already seen how Chhattisgarh developed after splitting from MP. So, can the same thing happen if Bundelkhand, Baghelkhand, or Mahakaushal become separate states?

Smaller states, better governance-
If a state is smaller, the government can focus properly instead of trying to manage such a large area with different problems.

Neglected regions might finally get attention. Right now, everything revolves around Bhopal-Indore, while the rest just has to manage with whatever they get.

Stronger cultural identity- Bundeli, Bagheli, and other regional languages are fading away. If these regions had their own state, maybe their language and culture would survive.

Economic growth- Chhattisgarh is doing well after splitting from MP, so maybe these regions could also develop faster on their own.

Of course, there are challenges too‚Äînew capitals, administrative costs, and political opposition. But the real question is, is staying one big state actually benefiting everyone, or is it time to rethink?

What do you think? Would dividing MP help in development, or is it unnecessary???

"MADHYA PRADESH : SERIAL CHILD RAPIST & A BROKEN JUDICIAL SYSTEM 

This rapist murderer monster is Ramesh Singh, a resident of Dabripura in Polaykala, Madhya Pradesh 

In 2003, He raped a 5 year old girl
Was convicted for 10 years 
Released in 2013

In 2014, he brutally raped an 8 year old girl again after his release
Was Convicted again, given death

In 2019, High Court overturned the verdict on technical grounds & set him free

In February 2025, he brutally raped & assaulted an 11-year-old hearing and speech impaired girl in Narsinghgarh Madhya Pradesh. She was rushed to Hospital in Bhopal, but she died

Such men just do not deserve to live. I fail to understand how could High Court acquit him after being given death sentence when he had already raped a little girl before the second assault. How?

"Harassed by Beggars in RKMP Railway Station Hello fellow Bhopalis,
 
This incident took place the day before yesterday. I ( early 20s, F) was at the station to receive my partner (also early 20s, M) around 7:20 AM and since there aren't a lot of places open that early to enjoy a meal in the area, we decided to wait and have some breakfast in the common waiting area itself. 

We were having some homemade sandwiches when a woman with a child approached us asking for money. When we politely refused she started asking for something to eat. At this point, I told my partner to get her something to eat out of kindness. We asked what she wanted and she said she wanted to eat Chowmein, my partner got her that. 

We resumed eating only to be approached by another more persistent woman. She even had the audacity to spew rubbish at us when we denied her demands for money and food. She tried to grab the water bottle we had just bought,  which angered me and I told her to leave immediately. My partner in order to get rid of her, gave the bottle and dismissed her. 

On the other side, the ""gang"" in which these women circulate in got into an argument with a vendor in the waiting area itself and were forced to go towards the platforms. This is a first for me, as these people aren't usually persistent with their approach and leave when denied. 

This makes me curious about the beggar situation in public places (particularly an esteemed station such as RKMP) in Bhopal and what places of authority can I file a complaint to if something similar happens again.

There were no police officials in the premises. So, I didn't know what to do. :/",Negative,2025-08-25 17:24:14,Mythohlogy,Reddit,,10,1,Bhopal,2025,8,25,17

"Complete red flag So, I recently started seeing a girl I met through Bumble but I sensed something through the conversation I had with her and during our meeting that she is complete what can I describe with only two words a complete 'Red Flag'. 
I met her was respectful, went on dinner and a long drive. But during the conversation I had with her she only talks about negative points of her family, how she don't like living with her parents, she don't like her hometown, she left her job and now jobless for almost few months and looking for a new job but she want work from home in Bhopal with good package, she want to get married and want her husband to be rich, she also said she don't think she will ever have any feelings for her life partner but she want a rich guy who can atleast pay her bills and so many things. 
I listened to hey patiently because I thought she is frustrated and want someone to listen to her and as nothing is better than a complete stranger who will not judge her for all her nonsense. 
But during our second meeting also she was the same. I told her that you should not compare your life with others, they have their own struggles, strengths and weakness and you have your own. Everything happen with different pace in everyone's life. And after that I didn't try to teach her or advice hey anything because it's not my with to parent hey properly or interfare with her life. 
She was jealous of her own friends. One of her works in a MNC and earns well, after dropping her friend she started talking about her friend and I patiently listened to her nonsense. I told her that, 'Your friend worked really hard and she must have her own struggles maybe you find her life enchanting but you didn't wear her shoes'.
That's all I can at that moment to her, although I know nothing will go inside her thick skull. 
Till now I went on so many dates, met so many women but she was the complete Red Flag for me. 
If you can't be happy and appreciate with what you have, you will only see negatives and will become a nuisance to others too.
